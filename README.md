# K30Admin

Aot compatible version of https://github.com/akveo/ng2-admin.

## Why

The original repo was moving slowly with regards to AOT. The aim is feature parity and performance improvements.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Flags

Ps: can be used with `ng serve too`.
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Use the `--aot` flag for aot build.

Mix and match to your liking.
