Aot compatible version of https://github.com/akveo/ng2-admin.

## Why

We were using @akveo/ng2-min and were about to go to production. <br>
It proved had to convert the original code to be AOT compatible. <br>
So we created this project based of angular-cli and are slowly converting the code to be AOT friendly.<br>
We are also looking into upgrading a couple of old dependencies.

We will be looking to contribute back to the original repo if possible.

## Goals

Feature parity <br>
Performance improvements <br>
Minimal version of this seed for smaller projects and instructions on how to add more features.

## Help is welcome and appreciated

The original repo was moving slowly with regards to AOT. The aim is feature parity and performance improvements.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Flags

Ps: can be used with `ng build` too. <br>
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. <br>
Use the `--aot` flag for aot build. <br>

Mix and match to your liking.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. <br>
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
